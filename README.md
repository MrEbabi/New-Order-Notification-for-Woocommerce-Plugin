# Woocommerce-Order-Notification

Woocommerce custom order page for showing a popup notification with sound when a new order received. 

Early usage (before the plugin): Check functions.php file. It is developed as a function that goes to functions.php of your theme. Upload two versions of your sound file as .ogg and .mp3 to the wp-content/uploads. Name your uploaded music files order-music.mp3 and order-music.ogg. Then copy the code to the your theme's functions.php (not replace them, just add the source code at the end of your functions.php file).

Now: New Order Notification for Woocommerce is developed as a plugin.
