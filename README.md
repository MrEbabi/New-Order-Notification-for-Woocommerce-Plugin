# Woocommerce-Order-Notification

Woocommerce custom order page for showing a popup notification with sound when a new order received. 

For now, it is developed as a function that goes to functions.php of your theme.

---

Usage: Upload your two versions of your sound file as .ogg and .mp3 to the wp-content/uploads. Name your uploaded music files order-music.mp3 and order-music.ogg. Then copy the code to the your theme's functions.php (not replace them, just add the source code at the end of your functions.php file).


To Do: It will be developed as a plugin with refresh time and upload mp3/ogg files option in admin panel.
